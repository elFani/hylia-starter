Hi, I'm Phillip and I'm interested in what happens when art meets the web.

I have 12+ years experience in frontend development, interface design, and UX design. I'm a former senior developer for the marketing arm of a global, video analytics company and UX Designer/frontend dev at UC San Diego, after managing the U.S. Soccer Federation's online presence and co-creating mobile app.

I'm fluent in English and Spanish with working competency in Portuguese.

I believe the web should be for everyone and great tools start with solid HTML and CSS with JS sprinkled in as necessary. This will help create clean, performant, and accessible experiences for everyone and every device. Start with a good foundation and the rest will follow.

Some things that I find interesting:

* Accessibility (a11y)
* Web Components
* Vanilla javascript
* Utility-based CSS, but...not overdoing it
* Soccer, calcio, f√∫tbol, futebol
* Coffee

A big shout out to [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw) and [Steph Eckles](https://twitter.com/5t3ph), who have helped me put this place together via their beautiful Eleventy resources and all around great teaching skills. It is an Eleventy site deployed via Netlify with a Netlify CMS backend. The starter project is based on Andy's [Hylia repo](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia).
