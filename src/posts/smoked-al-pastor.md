Going to post this here more as a reference and to share with others easily.

In general, all amounts are more guidelines than strict directions. I have combined two different recipes from around the internets to make this one.

## AL PASTOR MARINADE

3-4 pound Pork Loin cut into thin slices. Freeze overnight and transfer to fridge in the morning. Semi-thawed pork should be ideal for slicing in early afternoon.

1 Pineapple

### CHILES (USE AT LEAST 2 OF 3 LISTED)

* 4 dried guajillo chile 
* 2 dried ancho chili peppers
* 2 chipotle chili peppers in adobo sauce

### STANDARD MIXINS

* 4 cloves of garlic
* 1/2 onion
* 2 Tablespoons butter

### LIQUIDS

* 1/2 cup of orange juice
* 1/2 cup of pineapple juice
* 3/4 cup white vinegar (can substitute apple cider or use 50/50 mix)
* 3/4 cup chicken stock (can substitute vegetable stock)

(overall liquid amounts can be adjusted for taste and consistency as you prefer)

### DRY

* 1.5 Tablespoons achiote powder (or paste)
* 2 teaspoons cumin
* 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
* 1.5 Tablespoons kosher salt
* 1 Tablespoon of thyme
* 1 teaspoon of paprika
* 1 Tablespoon sugar
* 1 Tablespoon of pepper

### OPTIONAL

* 3 Cloves

Prepare the marinade. In a medium saucepan, melt butter and sweat onions and garlic until fragrant. Add all liquids (aside from vinegar) and chiles to the pan and bring to a boil. Cook the peppers and onions in the stock for 4-5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and stir in the dry ingredients and vinegar. Simmer the marinade for 4-5 more minutes.

Blend the marinade. Turn off the heat. Remove stems from chiles if you did not before boiling. Transfer the remaining contents of the pan to blender and blend until smooth. Allow to cool to at least room temperature. Marinade can be made a day in advance, if needed.

## PREP AND SMOKE THE PORK

After thinly slicing the pork, place in bowl and mix with marinade until all surfaces are covered. I've found slicing as thin as I can with a standard knife works fine - no need to get deli slicer thin. 

Place covered pork into sealed container or bag and leave in fridge overnight. You can also slice the pineapple the night before and store, or slice it right before you start the smoker.

Assemble vertical skewer and preheat smoker to 265-275F (hotter smoke temp with help with getting charred edges). Put skewer in disposable cake/pie pan to catch juices/fat as it drips off of the trompo (pork stack).  Stack slices of marinated pork on the skewer; top with a slice of pineapple (place slice at bottom optionally as well). 

Smoke for 4 hours and check internal temp is above 175F. Baste the trompo every 20-30 minutes from juices in the catch pan during the smoke process. Use any wood for smoking that goes well with pork - typically fruit tree woods (apple/cherry)
