I'm just making a spot here to record some past iterations of portfolio sites and blogs. I'll add more when/if I can track down source code or old domains.

## Angular app portfolio

This was a version of my base Angular web app from UCSD development that I adapted into a portfolio type site. The UI is very similar to what went into production for the university's apps.

## Blue blog

Built with Eleventy, this was based off of Steph Eckles' kickstart project. This was a good playground for playing with Eleventy tags and collections.

## Forestry blog

This was a templated blog with [forestry.io CMS](https://forestry.io/) baked in; also a great concentration on a11y and WCAG compliance.
