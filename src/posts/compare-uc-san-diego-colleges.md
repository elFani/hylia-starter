This utility for prospective UC San Diego students allows an applicant to compare and contrast the seven UCSD Colleges across three major criteria, as well as see a map of the general College Neighborhoods on campus.

Created by me from scratch, the tool allows for quick comparisons on desktop and mobile, while allowing students that want more thorough information to click through to more comprehensive destinations.
